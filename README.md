# This notebook illustrate the Preisach model

In "PreisachModel(ForwardModel).ipynb", we consider waveform (FORC data) and known Preisach density function, and calculate signals to develop loops along waveform.

We considered the irreversible denisty function as Gaussian and reversible density function as delta function

We show here, given a waveform, how the hysterons swtiches (on-off) over the defined Preisach plane-- finally to develop multiple signal loop structures.

User have the option to start with different initial conditions of the hysteron swtiching over the plane, depending on the knowledge or (no knowledge) on the starting sample of waveform

**Many more examples to be included later**
